# iRML-Reasoning
The implementation of iRML reasoning is based on the code released by https://github.com/xwhan/DeepPath.

## About the Dataset
We use the [FB15k-237](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1klWL11nW3ZS6b2MtLW0MHnXu-XlJqDyA/view?usp=sharing) released by the original [DeepPath: A Reinforcement Learning Method for Knowledge Graph Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06690) paper. `Semantic_Layering` is used for grouping the entities of the dataset into different semantic layers.
