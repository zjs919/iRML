# The relationship bewteen accuracy and number of degrees/layers.
This simulation shows the numerical results for accuracy and number of degrees/layers.
Data corresponding to different degrees/layers is pretrained and processed.
# How to use
Downlaod all the files under this folder and same them to the same path. Simplly run the `AccvsNum_degrees.m` or the `ACCvsNum_layers.m` file to see the numerical results.
